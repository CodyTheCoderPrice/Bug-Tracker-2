# Bug-Tracker

## Download and run locally

1. Have Postgres installed on your local machine. You can download it from here: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

2. Access your local Postgres and run all commands in the schema.sql file (found in the server folder).

3. Change the Postgres user/password info in the db.js file (found in the server folder) to your own. I used dotenv to keep my password secret.
